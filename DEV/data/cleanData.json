This music sheet cover of “The Fugitive’s Song” turns on its head the traditional newspaper advertisement for a fugitive slave to honor the esteemed leader. Although it depicts Douglass neither as writer not orator, but as a barefooted slave in flight, pointing at a signpost to New England seen on the right, the text below praises Douglass for his “fearless advocacy.” The song was one of a number of abolitionist compositions created by Jesse Hutchinson of the famous Hutchinson Family singers."

Aunque no lo ilustra como escritor ni orador, sino como un esclavo descalzo que huye y señala un letrero hacia Nueva Inglaterra, el texto al pie alaba a Douglass por su “defensa intrépida” de la causa abolicionista. Esta fue una de varias canciones abolicionistas creadas por Jesse Hutchinson, de la famosa familia Hutchinson de cantantes."

He had escaped from slavery in 1838 and subsequently became a powerful witness for abolitionism, speaking, writing, and organizing on behalf of the movement; he also founded a newspaper, the North Star. Douglass's charisma derived from his ability to present himself as the author of his own destiny at a time when white America could barely conceive of the black man as a thinking and feeling human being. The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is not only gripping nonfiction account of one man's struggle for freedom; it is also one of the greatest American autobiographies. This powerful portrait shows Douglass as he grew in prominence during the 1840s."

In the Break is an extended riff on \"The Burton Greene Affair,\" exploring the tangled relationship between black avant-garde in music and literature in the 1950s and 1960s, the emergence of a distinct form of black cultural nationalism, and the complex engagement with and disavowal of homoeroticism that bridges the two. Fred Moten focuses in particular on the brilliant improvisatory jazz of John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, Eric Dolphy, Charles Mingus, and others, arguing that all black performance--culture, politics, sexuality, identity, and blackness itself--is improvisation. For Moten, improvisation provides a unique epistemological standpoint from which to investigate the provocative connections between black aesthetics and Western philosophy. He engages in a strenuous critical analysis of Western philosophy (Heidegger, Kant, Husserl, Wittgenstein, and Derrida) through the prism of radical black thought and culture. As the critical, lyrical, and disruptive performance of the human, Moten's concept of blackness also brings such figures as Frederick Douglass and Karl Marx, Cecil Taylor and Samuel R. Delany, Billie Holiday and William Shakespeare into conversation with each other.\" -- Publisher's description"

        "content": "\"Within a few years of the invention of the first commercially successful photography process in 1839, American slaveholders had already begun commissioning photographic portraits of their slaves. Ex-slaves-turned-abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass also came to see how sitting for a portrait could help them project humanity and dignity amidst northern racism. In the first decade of the medium, enslaved people had begun entering southern daguerreotype saloons of their own volition, posing for cameras, and leaving with visual treasures they could keep in their pockets. And, as the Civil War raged, Union soldiers would orchestrate pictures with fugitive slaves that envisioned racial hierarchy as slavery fell. In these ways and others, photography powerfully influenced how bondage and freedom were documented, imagined, and contested. This book explores how photography altered, and was in turn shaped by, conflicts over bondage. Drawing upon an original source base that includes hundreds of unpublished and little-studied photographs of slaves, ex-slaves, and abolitionists as well as written archival materials, it puts visual culture at the center of understanding the experience of late slavery. It assesses how photography helped southerners to defend slavery, slaves to shape their social ties, abolitionists to strengthen their movement, and soldiers to imagine and pictorially enact an interracial society during the Civil War. With diverse goals, these peoples transformed photography from a scientific curiosity into a political tool. While this project sheds new light on conflicts over late American slavery, it also reveals a key moment in the much broader historical relationship between modern visual culture and racialized forms of power and resistance\" -- Provided by publisher"

For each of these moments, Smith shows how contemporary photographers utilize their medium as a way to recall, revise, or amplify the relationship between racial politics in the past and in the present. She argues that the tendency of African-American photographers and other artists to return to the archive of early photography does not simply point to the usefulness of early photography as document of the past, but to the recursive nature of photography itself. This study expands our theories of photography and memory by arguing that the recursive temporality of photography is central to its role in recording and remembering history. It also asserts that photography is an invaluable tool for critical practice of racial justice\"-- Provided by publisher"

        "content": "Rhodium has proven to be an extremely useful metal due to its ability to catalyze an array of synthetic transformations, with quite often-unique selectivity. Hydrogenation, C-H activation, allylic substitution, and numerous other reactions are catalyzed by this metal, which presumably accounts for the dramatic increase in the number of articles that have recently emerged on the topic. P. Andrew Evans, the editor of this much-needed book, has assembled an internationally renowned team to present the first comprehensive coverage of this important area. The book features contributions from leader."

These scenes include: enslaved women working in the field while their children are left alone; a freedwoman and her child watching as their free papers are destroyed by a man who has kidnapped them from the street; enslaved men being whipped and beaten; an enslaved woman watching as her child is taken away from her and sold; a slave auction; and a shipment of slaves being loading onto a ship at Baltimore bound for New Orleans. Above the images, the broadside challenges how slaveholders could see their slaves as people but not adhere to the rule of “Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.” Below the images, a quote from Unitarian preacher William Ellery Channing argues that keeping a man enslaved is just as much a crime as reducing him to slavery."

Before its retrocession to Virginia, the city of Alexandria had been part of the District of Columbia and served as one of the largest slave markets in the U.S. Towards the middle of the 19th century, a number of abolitionists moved to the capital and began calling for the end of the slave trade there."

In the first row of vignettes, a scene on the left depicts the signing of the Declaration of Independence, entitled “The Land of the Free,” and is contrasted with another on the right, “The Home of the Oppressed,” which features a group of slaves being led past the Capitol Building. A map of Washington is included between these two scenes, and contains two insets of slaves, one in a kneeling, suppliant position, and the other running from slavery, accompanied by an inscription, “$200 Reward.” The next row contains three images of prisons in Washington, built to detain unsold slaves and runaways. The broadside claims that many of these prisoners are actually free men and women, falsely accused of being slaves. The final row contains three illustrations of chained slaves leaving the slave house of J.W. Neal & Co., slaves being loaded onto a ship in Alexandria harbor, and the private slave prison of Franklin and Armfield, an Alexandria firm that was one of the largest slave traders in the antebellum South. The broadside concludes with a list of names of Congressmen and their voting record on the issue of slavery in the District of Columbia."

The parade lasted more than five hours, was over a mile in length, and had more than 20,000 spectators. Note the Baltimore Washington Monument in the background, the troop of Zouave drummers, and the African American men wearing Masonic sashes. The central image is surrounded by sixteen small vignettes containing portraits of individuals and events that were influential in securing voting rights for all American males regardless of race. These include four white men: Abraham Lincoln, in upper left President Ulysses S. Grant, a bust of abolitionist John Brown, abolitionist, orator, and Grant’s Vice President Schuyler S. Colfax. The African American leaders in the center are D.C. US Marshall Frederick Douglas, Mississippi Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels depicted sitting in Congress, and Martin Robison Delany, author and 1st African American major in US Army. The surrounding scenes optimistically depict the of expected benefits of the amendment such as a African American wedding ceremony presuming freedom to marry without impediment, a African American man voting, scenes depicting African Americans at worship and in school, and an image of former slaves tilling their own fields."

Fabian died in July 1988. The records consist mostly of files created by Stewart, Fabian, and others for exhibits that were proposed by museum staff for internal development, or external traveling exhibits that were considered for mounting at NPG. The files include staff evaluations and comments on proposed exhibits, exhibit scripts, documentation of brochure and catalog development, and memoranda between NPG staff as well as correspondence with potential exhibit donors. Some files also document NPG contributions to special traveling exhibits, and staff participation in symposia and seminars. The records include a small amount of administrative material, plus correspondence files of secretarial staff which consist mostly of replies to public inquiries. The records also include documentation of the book \"On Stage\" written by Monroe Fabian, and published in the spring of 1980. These files consist of correspondence regarding the use of quotations and images for \"On Stage,\" photographs, a manuscript, and an unbound copy of the published volume."

They also document the Deputy Director's interaction within and among the offices under her direction, as well as outside contacts and dealings. These records were created and maintained by Carolyn Kinder Carr, Deputy Director, 1991-. Among other duties, the Deputy Director serves as the Gallery's chief art historian and it is in this capacity that she curates exhibitions. Carr came from the Akron Art Institute to the National Portrait Gallery in 1984 as the Assistant Director for Collections. When the Assistant Director for History and Public Programs left the Gallery (c.1991), reorganization of the Gallery's upper administration took place. At that time, Carr was named Deputy Director and absorbed two programmatic responsibilities of the former Assistant Director for History and Public Programs. The service responsibilities (publications and the library) of the, now defunct, office were absorbed by the Assistant Director for Administration, later renamed the Associate Director for Administration (c. 1992). In her capacity as Deputy Director, Carr has direct responsibility for all the Curatorial Departments (Painting and Sculpture, Prints and Drawings, and Photographs); the Department of History; Office of the Registrar; the Center for Electronic Research and Outreach; the Conservation Department; and, the Department of Education. Materials include correspondence, memoranda, slides, photographs, reports, research reference files, obituaries, press packets, typescripts of catalogs, scripts, and related material. Four exhibition subjects mentioned in the files are noted as \"canceled\" and not listed in the official list of NPG exhibitions, they are: the Daguillard Collection, Oak Hill Cemetery, Uriah Levy, and Court Portraiture in the Reign of Phillip II. There is also a large group of files devoted to a proposed exhibition that was never produced, it was: \"Four Muses of Movement: Martha Graham.\""

        "content": "A graduate of the University of New Hampshire, BA, 1945 and the University of Michigan, MA, 1949, Warren Murray Robbins started his career as a secondary school teacher. He later served in the United States Foreign Service, holding a variety of educational and curatorial posts in Germany and Austria. After returning to the United States, Robbins established the Center for Cross Cultural Communication (CCCC) in 1962 to serve as an educational institute integrating, popularizing and utilizing the insights and perspectives of the social sciences and the arts to foster international and interracial understanding as well as communication between the academic world and a broader public audience. Once of first major projects of the CCCC was the creation in 1964 of the Museum of African Art (MAA). The museum was the extension of an interest in African art that Robbins developed while in Europe. The museum was originally located in the Washington, DC residence of Frederick Douglass and became part of the Smithsonian Institution in 1979 and was later renamed the National Museum of African Art (NMAfA) in 1981. During the 15 years that the MAA was in operation, the CCCC operated under the Museum's name. Following the Museum's inclusion as part of the Smithsonian it reverted back to its original corporate name with the inclusion of Robbins' name in the title to become the Robbins Center for Cross-Cultural Communication. From 1964 to 1982, Robbins was the Director of the MAA, later becoming the Founding Director Emeritus and Senior Scholar from 1982-1995. In June of 1995, the Smithsonian eliminated Robbins position as Founding Director Emeritus/Senior Scholar because of budgetary reasons. Subsequently Robbins sued the Smithsonian, but ultimately lost and was not able to be reinstated. After leaving the Smithsonian, Robbins continued his work at the Robbins Center for Cross Cultural Communications to apply the perspectives and insights of the social sciences and the arts in public education with particular emphasis on interracial understanding. Robbins passed away on December 4, 2008."

Humphrey, Margaret Mead and Ben Shahn, document the close relationships he had with a wide range of people as well as reveal his personality and character. The papers also include Robbins subject files and reveal his interests in African art, Piet Mondrian, and semantics among other things. Also included are records related to the creation and administration of the Museum of African Art, the work it took to get it included as part of the Smithsonian, its transfer, and the difficulties and conflicts Robbins experienced as a result. The records provide extensive coverage of the work involved in keeping the MAA a vibrant center of education, as well as documents the acquisition of collection material and the production of exhibitions. The papers also contain materials related to publications, including Robbins' African Art in American Collections, both the 1966 and 1989 editions.
